# Project Title: Design of Alloys for gaining high strength to weight ratio
Overview
This repository contains machine learning models developed for the "Design of Alloys with High Strength-to-Weight Ratio" project . The models aim to predict key properties of Aluminum (Al) alloys, specifically minimum density and maximum stress, to facilitate the design of new alloys with improved strength-to-weight ratios.
